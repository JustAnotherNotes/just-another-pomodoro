# Just Another Pomodoro

This is just another (CLI) pomodoro timer. Simple and minimalistic but functional.

It can be said that it is used as internal tool for working on notes project. But you can try it out, maybe you will find it useful.

# Support platforms

For now it works only on Linux and requires `libnotify-bin` package for notifications.

I plan to add support for Windows and MacOS in foreseeable future.
